# Just-The-Scraps

Just the Scraps is a free marketplace for fashion designers or people who love to sew but need help with what to do with their extra fabrics to donate them back to the community. 
This website allows you to post your fabrics, rolls of cloth, or fabric scraps, hoping others can make something out of nothing.
